# Why a fork?

This repository is a fork of the main Perfetto repository. In this fork, we include the `protoc` binaries directly in the [`/vendored_protoc` directory](./vendored_protoc)
instead of relying on the [`protoc_bin_vendored` crate](https://crates.io/crates/protoc-bin-vendored).

Our decision was driven by an issue with Bazel-based builds: for some reason, Bazel cannot locate the `protoc` binary when it is packaged via the
`protoc_bin_vendored` crateâ€”likely due to its architecture-dependent packaging. By including the appropriate `protoc` binary for each supported,
we simplify the build process and ensure proper detection by Bazel.

**If you intend to track the tip-of-tree (ToT) version, please ensure that you also update and copy over the corresponding `protoc` binaries.**
